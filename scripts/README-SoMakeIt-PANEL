Steps to run the software on the rpi:
1)  Attach the rpi to your ethernet port and power it up.
    You should get a link.
2)  Log into the rpi: ssh pi@fe80::ba27:ebff:fedf:d2dd%eth0
    There is no need to setup a network, the IP address is link-local
    only. The password is raspberry
3)  Go to ~/flipdots/rpi-demo
4)  Run ./udp-receiver


Steps to send an image to the panel:

1)  Create an image with an 60:32 ratio (60x32 works best).

2)  Execute the display-somakeit script in this directory with the
    image as argument.
    It transforms any image to the right size and sends it
    to the link local IP of the rpi.
